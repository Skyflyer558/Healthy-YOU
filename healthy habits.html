	<p>Drink lots of liquid, especially tapered water and hot fluids, like lemon tea, coffee, herbal teas.  Hot liquid, even if they sounds innapropriate, will help eliminate the viruses and bacterias faster.  Avoid cold drinks, even if they seem to aleviate the pain, they in fact, keep the bacterias and viruses stuck in your throat, which results in keeping you sick longer. Adding freshly squeezed lemon and a spoon of honey in your hot beverage is also pretty helpful.  </p><br><br><br><br>

	<p>At the firsts signs of a cold, we recommend that you take 150mg of vitamin C every hour, from rising up to 6pm.  No later than that, since it might cause insomnia.  And as you guessed, rest is very important when fighting a cold. On the second day though, take 150mg every 2 hours, from rising up to 6 pm. On the third day, take it every 3 hours.</p>
